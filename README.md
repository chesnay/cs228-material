# Tutorials for Stanford cs228 and cs231n for Python 3.6

Preparatory material for the probabilistic graphical models and the deep learning classes at Stanford.

## Material

This repo currently holds:

* An [updated tutorial](https://github.com/fchesnay/cs228-material/blob/master/tutorials/python/cs228-python-tutorial.ipynb) in Python 3.6 on basic Python/Numpy that is necessary to get started with the above machine learning classes.

The tutorial in Python 2.7 prepared by Volodymyr Kuleshov and Isaac Caswell can be found there [tutorial](https://github.com/kuleshov/cs228-material/blob/master/tutorials/python/cs228-python-tutorial.ipynb).

You may follow the iPython notebook on github, or clone and execute it locally.
The notebook is based on an [earlier version](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/) prepared by Justin Johnson.
